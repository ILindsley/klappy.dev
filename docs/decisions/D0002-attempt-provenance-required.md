# Attempt Provenance Required

> Every attempt must capture model provenance at registration to enable meaningful comparison between AI models.

## Description

This decision mandates that every attempt capture model provenance (agent, model, tool, git HEAD, timestamp) at registration time. If the model is unknown, the system proceeds but flags the degraded provenance. This enables forensic traceability and meaningful comparison between different AI models and approaches.

# D0002 — Attempt Provenance Required

## Decision

Every attempt must capture model provenance at registration time. If the model is unknown, proceed but flag the degraded provenance clearly.

## Status

**Active**

## Why

- If we can't tell which model produced which attempt, comparisons are contaminated
- "Unknown model" is not the same as "no provenance" — at least we know it's unknown
- Provenance must be captured at registration, not guessed later
- Enables meaningful comparison between different AI models/approaches

## Consequences

- ✅ Every attempt knows: who made it, what made it, where, when
- ✅ Branch names encode provenance: `run/v0.3/cursor-a/opus-45/abc123`
- ✅ META.json preserves provenance even after worktree is deleted
- ⚠️ Agents must provide `--agent` and `--model` flags
- ⚠️ Warning shown if model not provided (but doesn't block progress)

## Implementation

- Script: `/infra/scripts/attempt-cli.js` (`cmdRegister` captures provenance)
- Prompt: `/docs/PROMPT_ATTEMPT_KICKOFF.txt` instructs agents to provide flags
- Schema: `.attempt.json` and `META.json` include provenance fields

### Provenance Fields

| Field | Source | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `agent` | `--agent` flag | Human-friendly label (cursor-a, cursor-b) |
| `model` | `--model` flag | AI model identifier (opus-4.5, gpt-4o) |
| `git_head` | Auto-detected | SHA at registration time |
| `worktree_path` | Auto-detected | Filesystem location |
| `branch` | Auto-detected | Git branch name |
| `registered_at` | Auto-generated | ISO timestamp |

## Evidence

- Commit: `8e49616` — "feat: add model provenance tracking to attempt lifecycle"
- Problem observed: Multiple attempts existed but no way to know which AI model made which
