# Branch Names Are Convenience, Provenance Lives in META

> Branch names are optional human convenience; canonical provenance lives in META.json files.

## Description

This decision establishes that branch naming conventions are not authoritative—the canonical record of "who made what" lives in META.json. Since Cursor manages worktrees dynamically and attempt numbers are assigned after finalize, systems cannot rely on specific branch patterns. Cloudflare deploys any branch that builds; docs and tooling must not depend on branch naming conventions.

# D0007 — Branch Names Are Convenience, Provenance Lives in META

## Decision

Branch names are optional convenience for humans and tooling. The canonical record of "who made what" lives in `META.json`. Cloudflare and the attempt system must not depend on specific branch naming conventions.

## Status

**Active**

## Why

- Cursor manages worktrees and branches dynamically — we can't control names reliably
- Attempt numbers are assigned **after** finalize, not at branch creation
- Agents don't know their attempt number when they start
- Hardcoded branch patterns (like `attempt/prd-v0.2/a001`) were causing doc drift
- Cloudflare deploys any branch that builds — it doesn't parse branch names

## Consequences

- ✅ System is Cursor-proof and future-proof
- ✅ Branch naming can drift without breaking provenance
- ✅ Cloudflare config is simpler (just "any non-prod branch")
- ✅ Docs don't need updating when naming conventions change
- ⚠️ Humans can't infer provenance from branch names alone
- ⚠️ Must check `META.json` to know who made what

## Implementation

- Provenance schema: `.attempt.json` and `META.json` include `tool`, `agent`, `model`, `prd_version`, `run_id`, `git_head`
- Cloudflare: Configured to deploy all non-`prod` branches
- Docs: `CLOUDFLARE_CONFIG.md` describes deploy behavior, not branch naming

### What Gets Namespaced (Durable)

| Field | Location | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `prd_version` | META.json | Which PRD |
| `tool` | META.json | cursor, vscode, cli |
| `agent` | META.json | Agent ID within tool |
| `model` | META.json | AI model identifier |
| `run_id` | META.json | Unique identifier |
| `git_head` | META.json | SHA at registration |

### What Does NOT Get Namespaced

- Branch names (convenience only)
- Folder names in worktrees
- Cloudflare subdomain slugs

## Evidence

- Commit: `15dfa26` — "feat: add --tool flag to provenance tracking"
- Document: `/docs/CLOUDFLARE_CONFIG.md` — "Branch names are optional convenience"
- Problem observed: Docs assumed `attempt/prd-v0.2/a001` format, but Cursor doesn't create branches that way
